Why did Microsoft develop the Bot Framework?	While the Conversation User Interface (CUI) is upon us, at this point few developers have the expertise and tools needed to create new conversational experiences or enable existing applications and services with a conversational interface their users can enjoy. We have created the Bot Framework to make it easier for developers to build and connect great bots to users, wherever they converse, including on Microsoft's premier channels.	structured.docx		[]	false	[]	265
