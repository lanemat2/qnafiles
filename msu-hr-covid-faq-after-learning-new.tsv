How have Governor Whitmer's executive orders impacted the University in terms of employment?	The University never closed; the University has been in continuous, but limited, operation during the pandemic. Prior to June 5, the orders addressed the need for the people of Michigan “to remain at home or in their place of residence to the maximum extent feasible” due to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) disease. As of June 5, 2020, the executive orders requiring remote work for all non-necessary employees were rescinded. However, the University has established that employees should continue to work remotely whenever possible until further notice by an employee's supervisor. No one should come to work who is ill .Continue to check the site [remote.msu.edu/working](https://remote.msu.edu/working/index.html)  for updates.	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2384
Should I provide employees with face coverings?	Yes. The University will provide face coverings and any other required personal protective equipment for employees returning to campus. As such, units are expected to take the following action:\n\n1.  Place orders through the University Stores catalog in Spartan Marketplace ( [EBS login](https://login.msu.edu/?App=EBSP-SAP) required). To avoid duplicate orders, designate one person from your area to place the order. If you placed an order previously through the online survey and did not receive it, please reorder through University Stores. Additional information is available on the [University Services website](https://usd.msu.edu/news/2020/3/Updates.html) .\n\n2.  Once you receive the face coverings, coordinate with your employees to get the face coverings to them.University-provided face coverings will be made of cloth. Each employee performing in-person work will be issued one cloth face covering. The University will not be responsible for keeping employees’ face coverings clean; it is the employee’s responsibility to clean their face covering properly. Employees are allowed to use their own face coverings. Employees can view information on how to wear, clean and store face coverings by visiting the [Environmental Health and Safety website](https://ehs.msu.edu/_assets/docs/fact-sheets/cloth-face-covering-fact-sheet.pdf) .	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2385

Health, prescription, and dental benefits will continue with the normal University contribution for the duration of the FMLA leave, even if the employee’s paid accruals have been exhausted. [See MSU’s FMLA and PMLA policies.](https://hr.msu.edu/policies-procedures/index.html)	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2398
Is the newly allowed ability to use excused unpaid time in excess of the annual 10-day limit only available to employees not designated as necessary who have exhausted their accruals?	No. With supervisory approval, the option may be used by employees designated necessary or not necessary and regardless of whether other accrual types have been exhausted.	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2399
Can my unit refuse to allow me to use unpaid unexcused time in excess of the 10-day limit?	Yes, supervisory/unit approval is required to use the additional excused unpaid time option and units may refuse.  However, supervisors should be aware that refusing such a request may require the employee to be put on a leave of absence, which will have a negative impact on benefits.  Supervisors are encouraged to allow maximum flexibility unless approving such requests present significant operational problems.	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2400

The amount of money needed for my Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account (DCSA) has been impacted by COVID-19 due to a closure in my child(ren)’s daycare/school. How do I cancel or adjust the amount of money needed in my DCSA?	If you have a Dependent Care FSA for the 2020 plan year, you have several options for your account due to daycare being closed and/or summer camps being cancelled. If you relate to one of the scenarios below, follow this process for completing the [Offline Change Form](https://hr.msu.edu/benefits/life-change/documents/OfflineEnrollmentForm.pdf) ( Important Note: Please do not use Apple Preview to complete this form.):Complete the [Offline Change Form](https://hr.msu.edu/benefits/life-change/documents/OfflineEnrollmentForm.pdf) on the HR website. ( Important Note: Please do not use Apple Preview to complete this form.)\n\nSelect "Change in Childcare" as the reason for completing the form.\n\nIn the "Event Date" box, enter the date in which you were notified of the change or the date in which the change occurred.\n\nSubmit the form to MSU HR within 30 days of the Event Date (see instructions on the form for further submission details).\n\nExample 1:\n\nMy children are school aged and participate in summer camps. I have elected $1500 to cover expenses for the year. I have contributed $375 to date, but I have incurred $0 to date. I have been notified that these summer camps have been cancelled. I no longer need any amount for Dependent Care FSA.\nAnswer 1 : This situation would be considered a qualifying life event (change in childcare). You should complete and submit the [Offline Enrollment/Change Form](https://hr.msu.edu/benefits/life-change/documents/OfflineEnrollmentForm.pdf)  on the HR website. Important Note: Please do not use Apple Preview to complete this form. In this instance, you would input $375 for the Dependent Care FSA amount and select "Decrease Contribution" under the FSA section of the form. This will recalculate the amount you have elected for coverage to $375 from $1500 and stop further contributions. Unfortunately, the IRS does not permit a refund of pre-tax dollars that are contributed and available to the member. The amount of $375 that you’ve already contributed will be available to you to use for any qualified daycare expenses incurred for the 2020 FSA plan year (including the grace period). If the federal government decides to change this IRS regulation due to these unprecedented times, we will reach out to inform you of this update.\n\nExample 2:\n\nI have a child in daycare and our daycare is currently closed.  I have elected $5000 to cover expenses for the year. I have incurred $3200 to date and I have contributed $1250 to date. I expect that my child will not be returning to daycare since they will start kindergarten in the fall and they are home with me during the summer. I no longer need $5000 to cover expenses for the year, just the $3200 I’ve already incurred.\nAnswer 2 : This situation would be considered a qualifying life event (change in childcare). You should complete and submit the [Offline Change Form](https://hr.msu.edu/benefits/life-change/documents/OfflineEnrollmentForm.pdf) on the HR website. Important Note: Please do not use Apple Preview to complete this form. In this instance, you would put the amount of incurred expenses of $3200 in the Amount field and select "Decrease Contribution" under the FSA section of the form. This will recalculate the amount you have elected for coverage to $3200 from $5000. Deductions will continue but the amount deducted will be lower due to recalculating the new amount needed for the remainder of pay periods in the calendar year.\n\nExample 3:\n\nI have a child enrolled in before and after school care. I have elected $1200 to cover expenses for the year. I have incurred $650 to date and I have contributed $500 to date. Due to school being closed, I expect that I will not need before and after care until fall which will reduce my total costs by $250. This means I only need to elect $950 for the year instead of $1200.\nAnswer 3 : This situation would be considered a qualifying life event (change in childcare). You should complete and submit the [Offline Change Form](https://hr.msu.edu/benefits/life-change/documents/OfflineEnrollmentForm.pdf) on the HR website and select “Decrease Contribution” as the reason for completing the form.

What leave programs are available under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) for employees unable to work or telework due to COVID-19?	Employees may apply for EFMLA or EPSL if they are unable to work or telework and meet the eligibility criteria under EPSL or EFMLA.\n\n*   EFMLA : Emergency Family and Medical Leave Act (EFMLA) expands the FMLA temporarily (until Dec. 31, 2020) to provide 12 weeks of leave to care for of a minor child due to closing of school or daycare or unavailability of daycare because of COVID-19. The first two weeks of EFMLA leave are unpaid (but may be paid by the EPSL), while weeks 3-12 are paid with certain caps. All pay is at a rate of 2/3 an employee’s regular rate of pay.\n\n*   EPSL : Creates the Emergency Paid Sick Leave Act (EPSL) which provides for up to 80 hours of paid sick leave, with caps, to take care of oneself or another individual due to quarantine, COVID-19 or similar symptoms or to take care of a minor child due to closing of school or daycare because of COVID-19. Pay is at full or 2/3 rate, depending on which of the six qualifying reasons an employee is taking EPSL.Additional information on eligibility, key features, pay, and other important aspects of both the [EFMLA and EPSL leave programs is available here](https://hr.msu.edu/time-off-leave/ffcra.html) .\n\nHR Processes\n[Collapse All](javascript:collapseFAQ();)	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2406

How should faculty and academic staff report sick time if they are unable to work due to COVID-19?	The University does not provide a sick leave balance for faculty and academic staff. The general expectation for situations which may require faculty and academic staff to take time off for illness is that unit administrators extend professional courtesy and flexibility for employees under these circumstances and expect that arrangements are made for the work to be done. If, however, the time off interferes with the employee being able to fulfill their responsibilities, then the unit administrator and employee must have a conversation to discuss and evaluate the situation and other alternatives.	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2409

How should units complete I-9 Section 2 verifications if there is no ability to view employment eligibility documents in-person?	On Mar. 20, 2020, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced that it will exercise discretion to defer the physical presence requirements associated with the Form I-9. Employers with employees taking physical proximity precautions due to COVID-19 will not be required to review the employee’s identity and employment authorization documents in the employee’s physical presence. MSU verifiers still must inspect the Section 2 documents remotely (e.g., over video link, fax or email, etc.) and obtain, inspect, and retain copies of the documents within three business days for purposes of completing Section 2.\n[Units can find steps to complete these temporary provisions here.](https://hr.msu.edu/ua/i9/coronavirus-resources.html)For questions regarding the completion of I-9s using the temporary provision authorized by U.S. Department of Homeland Security, please email [HR.I9Admin@hr.msu.edu](mailto:HR.I9Admin@hr.msu.edu?subject=) .\n\nFaculty & Academic Staff Hiring Modifications (including Executive Management)\n[Collapse All](javascript:collapseFAQ();)	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2413
The President’s memo said all hiring decisions must be approved by the relevant vice president or provost, who will consult with the president as needed. Who are the relevant vice presidents for faculty and academic staff positions?	For purposes of faculty and academic staff positions, relevant vice presidents are defined as the vice president for which your unit reports.\n\nMost academic units, except the human health colleges, report to the Acting Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs (T. Jeitschko). The Colleges of Human Medicine, Nursing, and Osteopathic Medicine report to the Executive Vice President for Health Sciences (N. Beauchamp). Some academic support units report to the Interim Senior Vice President for Research and Innovation (D. Gage).\n[The President’s memo said that faculty and academic staff hiring processes already begun for Fall Semester 2020 (i.e., Aug. 2020) may continue, but that all other positions already posted should be reviewed for discussion with the relevant vice president or provost, taking into consideration both the status of the hiring process, and the necessity of the position and urgency with which it must be filled. What exactly does this mean?](https://hr.msu.edu/news/coronavirus-faqs.html)Given the numerous scenarios of where the unit may be in the hiring process, a chart has been developed and is available [here](https://hr.msu.edu/ua/hiring/faculty-academic-staff/hiring-modifications.html) . The chart outlines the different stages of the hiring process as well as the anticipated start date, and indicates whether approval is needed from the relevant vice president.\n\nIn general:\n\n*   Any open position that has not yet been posted on the HR website or submitted in EBS workflow as of Mar. 27, 2020 requires approval from the relevant vice president before proceeding.\n\n*   Any open position for which there is an anticipated start date prior to fall 2020, and for which an offer has not yet been accepted, requires approval from the relevant vice president before proceeding.	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2414
UPDATED: What is the process for obtaining the relevant vice president’s approval?	In those cases where vice president approval is needed, the form “ [Hiring Approval Form for Posting and Hiring at MSU](https://hr.msu.edu/ua/hiring/documents/hiring-modification-approval-form.pdf) ” must be completed* and appropriate signatures must be obtained before the unit can proceed further with the hiring process. (Use Internet Explorer to view the form, and download and save to complete.) Dean approval is also required for academic colleges. In those cases where the Dean may be communicating directly via email with the Provost, the Hiring Approval Form must still be completed and attached for approval.\n\nAs a reminder, for purposes of faculty and academic staff positions, relevant vice presidents are defined as the vice president for which your unit reports.\nMost academic units, except the human health colleges, report to the Acting Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs (T. Jeitschko, effective 7/1; T. Woodruff, effective 8/1). In this instance, please send the completed form with the dean signature to Sarah Blanck, [blancks@msu.edu](mailto:blancks@msu.edu) .The completed form with the appropriate signatures must be attached to the academic position request, the academic position exception request form or hiring form as noted in the [hiring chart](https://hr.msu.edu/ua/hiring/faculty-academic-staff/hiring-modifications.html) .\n\n*The human health colleges should use the form developed and provided by the Executive Vice President for Health Sciences.	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2415
The chart indicates that hiring processes already begun for Fall 2020 may continue. But what if the department wants to hire a tenure system faculty member prior to Aug. 16, 2020. The start date may be Jul. 1, 2020. Does this require approval from the relevant vice president?	No. Indicate in the comments of the appointment form that the start date was adjusted from fall, 2020 to summer semester, 2020.	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2416
Prior to receiving the President’s memo, we made an offer for a faculty / academic staff position and the candidate accepted the offer. Does this impact our offer?	All offers of employment which were made and accepted prior to Mar. 27, 2020 will be honored. However, we recommend that units assess whether it is necessary to delay the employment start date due to the statewide suspension of in-person operations as well as consideration of the impact to the onboarding process. The University wants its new employees to be equipped with the necessary knowledge and tools to be successful in their role and appropriate onboarding may be significantly disrupted during this time.

Units are asked to keep their head count for these positions consistent at this time. Hiring new graduate assistants to replace departing ones is acceptable, but units should not increase headcount over current levels without seeking permission from the unit’s appropriate vice president or provost. Approval in these circumstances requires completion of the Hiring Approval Form. In addition, hiring for any of these positions that are grant funded will be monitored by the Office of the Senior Vice President for Research and Innovation (OVPRI).

What if there is no obvious MSU work that my employees can do remotely?	Challenging times like this call for creativity. Are there materials that require reading and review that can be done remotely? As a professional development assignment, is there a job-related book that can be read or an online course that can be taken? It is hard to imagine that there is any job at MSU for which there is not some personal professional development work that could be done remotely and could increase one’s capacity or improve one’s performance when we return to more normal times.	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2436
What resources does MSU have available that can assist with remote professional development?	All benefits eligible employees have access to free online learning in elevateU. This tool can assist and support employees with boosting skills in a wide variety of areas. Consider goals set for the year, skills needed for upcoming projects or taking a deeper dive into Excel or Access. Topics cover a broad range and include productivity tools (desktop), leadership development, project management, IT professional skills, emotional intelligence, wellness, and more. elevateU also has thousands of e-books and audio books available that can be searched by title or author.	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2437
Does elevateU have resources related to professional certifications?	Yes, those with a professional certification may be able to get CE credits by taking courses through elevateU.

My employees are working remotely, but without their normal routine, they may have extra time in their day. As their supervisor, what can I do to assist?	Once the team is up and running remotely and a routine is established, supervisors might consider assigning a common experience to work on as a group. Teams can watch a video together and discuss key points. Each team member could choose a topic to explore and then “teach back” to the rest of the team.\n\nLeading by example can ease the anxiousness employees can experience. You have the power to creating space to facilitate the connectedness you may be missing. Other ideas include creating a virtual book club using the same book with a weekly discussion segment. We’d recommend selecting resources that will align with team or unit goals, or other common interest like “improve communication”.	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2439
Is professional development work appropriate work to assign to an employee?	Yes, individual employees should feel encouraged to pursue professional development. Consider areas that align with performance goals or new skills needed for upcoming projects or initiatives. Certificates of completion are available for those who complete a course and pass the exam at 75% or better. Taking a class, reading up on areas of professional expertise isn’t just “busy work”. We know that creativity and innovation are sparked by learning something new.	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2440

May an employee supplement or adjust the pay mandated under the FFCRA with other paid leave available to the employee?	No.	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2474
If an employee’s hours are reduced, can the employee use EFMLA or EPSL for the hours that the employee is no longer scheduled to work?	No.	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2474
Does an employee have a right to return to work if they are taking EFMLA or EPSL?	Yes, the Acts require employers to provide the same (or a nearly equivalent) job to an employee who returns to work following leave.	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2475
If an employee takes EFMLA or EPSL does that count against other types of paid sick leave to which they are entitled?	No, but an employee that is taking EFMLA or EPSL cannot supplement those leaves with other types of leave.\n\nOn-Call Employees\n[Collapse All](javascript:collapseFAQ();)	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2476
I’m an on-call employee who was told I am necessary under the Michigan Executive Orders. I do not want to keep coming to work. Can I use EPSL?	No, under reason #1 you have to be unable to work.	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2477

I am a student employee and left school when classes shifted to online. Am I eligible for EPSL?	No, the leave is only for employees who had to stop working because of the Michigan Executive Orders.	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2480
I am a student employee. I was told by my supervisor that I was not necessary under the Michigan Executive Orders and to stop reporting to work, and that I am not able to telework. Am I eligible for EPSL?	Yes, as long as you meet the documentation requirements.	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2481
I am a student employee and was told by my supervisor that I was able to telework. Am I eligible for EPSL?

Can you use the 80 hours intermittently for EPSL?	It depends on the reason. If you are a necessary employee who must come to the worksite, you cannot take EPSL intermittently for any reason except #5. For example, you cannot take intermittent leave if you have been deemed necessary to come to your worksite, but you have COVID symptoms. Those who are teleworking can potentially take EPSL intermittently, depending on the specific reason, if both supervisor and employee agree.	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2483

Does an employee qualify for EFMLA for a COVID-19 related reason even if he or she has already used all or some of their FMLA leave?	An eligible employee is entitled to paid sick leave under the EPSL regardless of how much leave they have taken under the FMLA. However, an employee may only take a combined total of 12 work weeks for FMLA or expanded family and medical leave reasons during the 12-month fiscal leave period. An employee’s eligibility for EFMLA depends on how much leave they have already taken during the 12-month fiscal year period.	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2485
If an employee is currently on leave after childbirth, is unable to telework, and their daycare provider is closed, are they entitled to EFMLA?	No. The reason they are on leave is child bonding, which is not related to COVID-19.	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2486
I was approved for FMLA prior to the COVID-19 situation. May I use the MSU 56 hours of leave time to cover an FMLA absence?	No, the 56 hours expired on April 2, 2020.	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2487
I was approved for FMLA prior to the COVID-19 situation. My condition is severe anxiety and depression which has been exacerbated by this situation. I’m out of paid time off. May I use the MSU 56 hours of leave time as well as the leave programs to cover FMLA-related absences?	EPSL and EFMLA do not cover anxiety alone. You would have to meet the criteria in the acts, such as experiencing COVID-19 symptoms and seeking a medical diagnosis.	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2488
Can you use EFMLA in both this fiscal year and next?	Yes, if you have any EFMLA left during the 2020-2021 fiscal year. The MSU FMLA year (which is the same as the MSU fiscal year) begins in July 1. At that point, employees get a new batch of 12 FMLA weeks. So, if you had only taken two weeks of EFMLA before July 1 (and haven’t reached the aggregate caps), you may be entitled to ten more weeks of EFMLA in the next fiscal year through December 31 when EFMLA expires.	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2489
I am currently on FMLA for COVID-19 related symptoms. Do I continue FMLA while also using EPSL?	You may be able to, if you qualify for both a Serious Health Condition under the FMLA and the criteria under EPSL.\n\nLeave Processes\n[Collapse All](javascript:collapseFAQ();)	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2490
Who is a full-time employee and who is a part-time employee under the EPSL?	For purposes of the EPSL, a full-time employee is an employee who is normally scheduled to work 40 or more hours per week. A part-time employee is an employee who is normally scheduled to work fewer than 40 hours per week. The EFMLA does not distinguish between full-time and part-time employees.	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2491
How do you calculate the hours worked by a part-time employee for purposes of EPSL or EFMLA?	A part-time employee is entitled to leave equivalent to their average number of work hours in a two-week period. Therefore, you calculate hours of leave based on the number of hours the employee is normally scheduled to work. If the normal hours scheduled are unknown, or if the part-time employee’s schedule varies, you may use a six-month average to calculate the average daily hours.	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2492
What is an employee’s regular rate of pay for purposes of the FFCRA?	The regular rate of pay which is used to calculate an employee’s paid leave under FFCRA is the average of his or her regular rate over a period of up to six months prior to the date on which the employee takes leave.	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2493
What is the purpose of furloughs during the COVID-19 health care crisis?	The purpose of negotiating furloughs was to provide units that are experiencing significant budget challenges due to the COVID-19 crisis a way to achieve short-term financial savings while protecting employees from loss of employer-paid health, life and dental benefits during the pandemic and allowing for a faster and more targeted recall of staff to their jobs when campus operations return to a more normal state.	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2494
Who can be furloughed?	Furloughs can only be implemented for employees in the following labor associations:\n\n*   Administrative Professional Association (APA) - [View the agreement here.](https://hr.msu.edu/contracts/documents/LOA-MSU-APA-5-7-20.pdf)\n\n*   Administrative Professional Supervisor Association (APSA) - [View the agreement here.](https://hr.msu.edu/contracts/documents/LOA-MSU-APSA-5-28-2020.pdf)\n\n*   Clerical-Technical Union (CTU) – View the agreement here (link).\n\n*   Local 1585 – View the agreement here (link).\n\n*   Local 274 – View the agreement here (link).For non-union support staff, contact the Solutions Center Support Staff Layoff Team at [AVPHR.TMAmail@campusad.msu.edu](mailto:AVPHR.TMAmail@campusad.msu.edu) .	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2495
How does this impact employees we may have already recently laid off?	APA and CTU employees who received layoff notices between Apr. 30, 2020 and when their respective furlough agreements went into effect will have their layoffs rescinded and will be placed on furlough.	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2496
What employee groups are still subject to layoff?	At this time, layoffs may still be initiated for support staff employees in positions represented by SSTU, Local 324 and POAM.	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2497
How do I initiate furloughs?	Units can send requests to initiate furloughs for employees by emailing the Support Staff Hiring/Layoff Team in the MSU HR Solutions Center at our main talent management email address ( [AVPHR.TMAmail@campusad.msu.edu](mailto:AVPHR.TMAmail@campusad.msu.edu) ). An HR Analyst will respond to your request by emailing the unit a furlough checklist outlining what materials need to be provided and discussing any questions the unit has.	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2498
What kind of materials will we be asked to provide and why?	The materials requested assist MSU HR in analyzing furlough lists from units to ensure the selection of employees to be furloughed within a unit is in compliance with the agreement. Units will be asked to provide their unit org chart, a list of names, job titles, classifications and work locations of people the unit wants to furlough, and some other materials that allow the team to analyze the request to ensure it meets seniority provisions of agreement. If you would like to [view a copy of the furlough checklist](https://hr.msu.edu/ua/layoff-resources/documents/support-staff-furlough-checklist.pdf) before initiating your request, it may assist you in preparing for the furlough process.	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2499
The agreements say we can transition people from furlough to layoff if we aren’t able to bring them back to work. How soon can units start that transition to change furloughs to layoffs if we need to do so?	Please keep in mind that one of the goals of implementing furloughs is to help units achieve necessary short-term savings while avoiding leaving employees without benefits during a pandemic for up to the next six months. If a unit needs to transition furloughs to layoffs, it may make sense to initiate that change in accordance with contractually required notice periods for layoffs to ensure employees continue to have benefits. Contact the Support Staff Hiring/Layoff Team if you feel you need to initiate layoffs and an HR Analyst will discuss options with you at that time.	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2500
What information is available to units to help employees understand the impact on their pay and benefits if they are selected for furlough?	It may be helpful to [read the FAQs that have been prepared specifically for employees about furloughs](https://hr.msu.edu/layoff-resources/furlough-faqs.html) .	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2501
What are the seniority rules for selecting employees to furlough under the agreement?	There are differences in the agreements, but in general, furloughs will be determine dby seniority within a unit (or department for CTU) and, within a primary work location and within an employment classifications. Please review the final agreements for more details applicable to each union.	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2502
How should units handle requests from employees to volunteer for furlough?	If employees request to be furloughed, units should honor those requests if operationally possible. Units do have the authority to decline these requests for operational reasons but must then describe the reasons for the denial in writing to both the employee and the union. Employees being furloughed because they volunteered to do so should be identified as volunteers on furlough lists submitted to HR so their seniority dates aren’t included in the analysis of employees the unit is choosing to furlough. Proof of the intent to volunteer must also be submitted. This can be a written request or an email from the employee stating they wish to volunteer.	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2503
How long should we expect it to take for HR to process furloughs?	HR will make every effort to process furlough requests within five business days from receiving a unit’s checklist materials, but the length of processing time is somewhat dependent on the volume of requests received in any given week and whether or not the unit has followed the seniority guidelines for selection outlined in the agreement. We will make every effort to process furloughs as quickly as possible, but we do recommend submitting your request and checklist materials at least a week in advance of the date you would like the seven-day notice to begin.	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2504
How will my employees be notified of being put on furlough?	They will receive an email from HR to their MSU Net ID email address. Their supervisor and/or a central unit HR administrator will be copied in order to facilitate communication between your unit and the employee. If requested, a unit HR administrator may also be copied. In addition, the union will be copied on the email as well. We recognize that the COVID-19 situation makes in-person conversations difficult, but we do recommend a unit HR administrator or supervisor follow up with the employee via phone or email to discuss the furlough with the employee. The email sent to the employee will also provide contact information for a team at MSU HR that can assist employees in understanding the terms of their furlough.	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2505
Will my employee’s accesses to email, EBS and campus buildings be turned off during furlough?	Employee e-mail addresses will remain active but you should not use email to assign or allow the employee to do work while on furlough. During furlough email should only be used to provide information relevant to the employee’s furlough. [EBS employee selfservice](https://hr.msu.edu/ebshelp/using-the-ebs-portal/who-gets-what/ess.html) access will remain active to allow the employee to complete functions like updating their address and personal information and participating in open enrollment. Any work related EBS access or building accesses will remain in place unless the unit takes steps to revoke or turn that access off.	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2506
Who are the best contacts to work with in MSU HR regarding furloughs?

Any premiums that are were deducted prior to the furlough will need to be paid and an invoice will be sent. You can view a more detailed breakdown on benefits on the [employee resource webpage](https://hr.msu.edu/layoff-resources/furlough.html) .	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2508
Will units need to submit the salary reduction for anyone who is eligible for the pay reduction?	No, units will not need to submit salary reductions for individuals eligible for the temporary pay reduction.

Is the temporary salary reduction based on the actual salary or the overall full-time equivalent salary?	When determining the reduction percentage on the graduated scale, the actual salary should be used to determine the reduction percentage.	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2511
Will the reduction apply to a faculty or academic staff member who drops below 90% FTE after September 1, 2020 implementation?	No, if an individual is no longer in the eligibility criteria for the temporary reduction, they will not incur any further salary reductions effective the date of change.	https://github.com/lanemat2/qnafiles/raw/main/msu-hr-covid-faq-copy.docx		[]	false	[]	2512
